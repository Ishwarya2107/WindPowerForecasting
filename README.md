# WindPowerForecasting
A machine learning project that aims in forecasting the wind power generated by 5 different windmills for the next 24 hours
## 1. Fetching Weather Data:
The requests.get method initiates an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API's onecall
endpoint, passing parameters such as latitude, longitude, date, and the API key.
The API response, containing a wealth of weather data for the specified location and date, is
processed using json.loads to convert the raw JSON data into a Python dictionary for ease of
manipulation.
## 2. Data Processing:
Hourly wind speed and direction data are extracted from the OpenWeatherMap API response,
providing a detailed temporal breakdown of meteorological conditions over a 48-hour period.
Simultaneously, the code loads historical wind power data from the 'Wind_power_data.csv' file
into a pandas DataFrame. Handling missing values is crucial, and in this implementation, rows
with missing values are dropped.
The dataset is then split into feature variables (X), representing weather conditions, and the
target variable (y), representing wind power data. This separation facilitates supervised
machine learning training, where the model learns patterns from features to predict the target.
## 3. Linear Regression Model:
The scikit-learn library is leveraged for data splitting using train_test_split. This process
partitions the dataset into training and testing sets, enabling model training and evaluation on
distinct data subsets.
A linear regression model is instantiated using the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn.
This model is then trained on the training set, and predictions are made on the testing set.
Comprehensive model evaluation metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and R-squared values, are calculated to gauge the accuracy and performance of
the linear regression model on both training and testing data.
## 4. Cross-Validation:
Cross-validation is performed using the cross_val_score function, employing k-fold
cross-validation with k=5 (five folds).
Three essential regression metrics, namely mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error
(MAE), and R-squared, are computed for each fold, providing a robust assessment of the
model's generalization performance.
## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning with Random Forest:
A machine learning pipeline is constructed using make_pipeline to streamline preprocessing
steps and the application of a random forest regression model.
Hyperparameter tuning is conducted through GridSearchCV, a powerful tool for systematically
searching hyperparameter space. The grid consists of different combinations of 14
hyperparameters, and the model is trained and evaluated for each combination to identify the
best-performing set of hyperparameters.
The best hyperparameters, such as the number of estimators and maximum depth, are then
extracted, and the tuned model is evaluated on the testing set.
## 6. Model Evaluation and Visualization:
The tuned model's performance on the testing set is thoroughly evaluated, and key metrics are
printed for detailed analysis.
To offer a visual representation of model predictions, matplotlib is employed to create a plot
comparing true and predicted power values. This allows for an intuitive understanding of how
well the model aligns with the actual wind power data.
## 7. Wind Turbine Power Prediction:
Wind turbine specifications for Siemens Gamesa SG 5.8-170, Vestas V150-5.6 MW, General
Electric (GE) 2.7-120, Nordex N149/4.0-4.5, and Suzlon S66 are provided.
Predicted power values for each wind turbine are calculated using the trained machine learning
model. This step provides insights into how well the model generalizes to different turbine
specifications, offering practical applicability beyond the training data.
## 8. Model Serialization:
The best-performing model is serialized using joblib.dump, a mechanism for persisting the
trained model to disk. This serialized model file, 'best_model.pkl,' allows for seamless
reloading of the model without the need for retraining. This is particularly useful in deployment
scenarios where efficient model serving is essential.
The model demonstrates proficiency in utilizing weather data to estimate wind power
generation, and its performance is thoroughly evaluated across various metrics.
The serialized model file opens avenues for future use without retraining, contributing to a
more streamlined and efficient workflow in real-world applications.
